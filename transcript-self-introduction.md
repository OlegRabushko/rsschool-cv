   Hello, my name is Oleg and I’m a junior frontend developer. I’m 22 years old, I got marred 1 year ago. Now I live with my wife in church in Zaslavl city, and we are waiting the birth our son. 
   
   I success completed Institute of Entrepreneurship in 2020. During my studies in University, I managed worked in department of science and information technologies. Then One business men invited me become a head of him company and for the next 8 months I was a head of company Ledy Tanvira.
   
   After I started learn frontend developing, because I solved for myself that this sphere more interesting for me than economics professions. At present moment attending the RSSchool frontend course. 
   
   Ok, about my plans. I would like learn such technologies as: Typescript, NodeJS and different JS library’s. I started my programming my education in July 2020 and at this moment I know JS, CSS, HTML, React, Redux, Sass preprocessors. 
During my studies in programming I did created simple social network by videos on channel IT-Kamasutra, using React and Redux. 
Also I created 2 landing, completed different test tasks. 

   I’m began passed a internship. In this time, I was should create a Notes app. This app should have a calendar with notes and this notes people could leave a note and also choose 2 dates. And my app should have shown all note between dates. Internship consisted of 4 parts, and what I was talking about above consisted of 2 parts. I success passed 2 parts but company just stopped answer my questions. Internship I’m not completed. 
   
   About problems with I had in the tasks. Almost all new that I did caused difficulties. But most difficult for me appeared it’s a typing Redux, many links many confusions. Had a difficult in short track tasks witch connected with data structures. But I founded a video from last course of RS School, in which Anton Bely explained this topic and I was able to completed tasks.
   
   I like programming, and believe that diligence and perseverance will help me become a highly qualified specialist.
